# Personal website for Charlotte Chang

This is a personal website for [Charlotte 
Chang](https://charlottehchang.github.io). I am a fan of dogs, grandmas, 
birds, chilies, soup noodle, and open-source software. I have different 
hats that I wear depending on projects that I'm working on; my projects 
span social-ecological systems, machine learning, conservation social 
science, quantitative ecology, muddy boots 
tropical socio-ecology, and mathematical theory. In the past, my website 
was built using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), 
and I tried out [Academic Hugo](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/). 
Another great option is rolling your own website with [R 
Markdown](https://github.com/EEB504/rmarkdown-website-examples) (this 
website has instructions for a scientific computing short course that I 
taught and was forked from the 
[original](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-website-examples)). Thank 
you to the community of devs that make these amazing resources publicly 
available!

## Building a personal website from R Markdown files

Following advice from [Nick 
Strayer](http://nickstrayer.me/RMarkdown_Sites_tutorial/) and [Lisa 
McManus](lmcmanus47.github.io)

## Current approach

I've now adapted and copied the HTML website and CSS stylesheet developed 
by [Sarah Meiklejohn](https://smeiklej.com/).
